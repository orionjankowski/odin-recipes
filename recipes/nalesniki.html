<h1>Naleśniki (Polish Crepes)</h1>

<img src="./images/nalesniki.jpg">

<p>Polish naleśniki (nah-lesh-NEE-kee) are crepe-like pancakes that can be made thin, as in this recipe, 
or as a thick Polish crepe. They can be enjoyed with either sweet or savory fillings. Every Eastern 
European country has its version of pancakes or crepes, such as Croatian palačinke, Serbian palacinke, 
Polish naleśniki, and Hungarian palacsinta.</p>

<p>Once filled and rolled, they can be baked or pan-fried. Another variation is to dip them in beaten egg 
and breadcrumbs before frying or baking.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>

<ul>
<li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
<li>1/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, for frying (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
<li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
<li>In a blender or food processor combine the flour, milk, water, eggs, butter, and salt. Process until smooth.</li>
<li>Transfer batter to a pitcher. Cover the pitcher with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes so liquid can 
    be absorbed by the flour.</li>
<li>Heat a crepe pan or small skillet over medium heat and lightly coat with butter. Using a 2-ounce ladle, spoon 
    1 portion of batter into pan.</li>
<li>Immediately rotate pan and swirl batter until it covers the entire bottom of the pan. Cook until crepe is 
    lightly brown or spotted brown on underside. Flip and cook second side until it is light brown.</li>
<li>Remove crepe to waxed paper or parchment paper and repeat with remaining batter. You may need to recoat the 
    pan with butter as you cook crepes.</li>
<li>Place 2 heaping tablespoons of savory filling or sweet filling on each naleśniki. Fold sides in first and 
    then fold bottom up, rolling away from yourself, similar to an egg roll or burrito.</li>
<li>Filled naleśniki should then be pan-fried in butter over medium-high heat or baked in a buttered casserole 
    dish at 350 F until the filling is set.</li>
