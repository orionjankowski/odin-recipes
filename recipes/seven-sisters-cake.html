<h1>Seven Sisters Cake (Siasto Stefanka)</h1>

<img src="./images/seven-sisters-cake.jpg">

<p>Americans of Eastern European descent have come to call the Polish ciasto stefanka 
and Hungarian stef√°nia torta by the name seven sisters cake, referring to its seven 
layers (six layers in most Hungarian versions). It can be made as a loaf cake or a 
round cake and resembles Hungarian dobos torta without the caramel topping. This cake 
is in no way related to Danish seven sisters cake, which is an almond-butter ring 
coffee cake.</p>

<p>Instead, Eastern European seven sisters cake has many iterations, but the one 
Americans are most familiar with is a torte made with layers of vanilla sponge cake, 
cocoa buttercream filling, and cocoa glaze. At first blush, the cake appears to be 
difficult to make but, if you follow the easy steps in this recipe, it's a snap.</p>

<h1>Steps</h1>
    <h4>Make the Sponge Cake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 350 F. In a large bowl, cream 1/2 pound butter and 
            1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 4 eggs, then flour, salt, 
            and 1 teaspoon vanilla until smooth. Lightly coat the bottom of seven 
            (8-by-4-inch) disposable aluminum loaf pans with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Weigh the batter (remembering to subtract for the weight of the bowl). 
            Divide that number by 7 and that's how many ounces you will need for 
            each pan in order to create even layers.</li>
            <li>Bake for 7 minutes or until the edges are very lightly brown. Don't 
            overbake. Remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes. Run a knife around 
            the edges of the pans and invert onto a cake rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Make the Cocoa Buttercream Filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, beat the 1/2 pound butter until light and fluffy. 
                Add the 2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, mixing until well incorporated, 
                and then beat for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1 pasteurized egg or whipping cream and beat for 2 more minutes. 
                Stir in the 1/3 cup cocoa powder and then beat until well combined.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4>Make the Glaze</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the 4 tablespoons melted butter, 4 tablespoons 
                cocoa powder and hot water.</li>
            <li>Blend in 2 cups confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla until smooth.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Assemble the Cake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place one cooled cake layer on a serving plate and spread with 1/7 of the 
                cocoa buttercream filling. Continue in this manner until all 7 sponge layers 
                have been stacked. Leave the top and sides of the cake bare.</li>
            <li>Pour the cocoa glaze over the top of the cake and, using a cake spatula, 
                spread the overflow around the sides of the cake to cover it completely. 
                The chocolate glaze will harden, which is what you want. Chill until set.</li>
            <li>Serve thin slices of this rich cake and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
